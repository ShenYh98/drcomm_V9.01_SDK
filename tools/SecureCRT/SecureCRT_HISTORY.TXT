Changes in SecureCRT 6.0.3 (Official) -- July 24, 2008
------------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

  - The active toolbar theme was not saved when SecureCRT was closed
    and restarted.
  - The status bar always used the "Office 2000" theme regardless of
    the currently selected theme.
  - If a custom menu (.MNU) file specified a system menu, the system
    menu reverted to the default menu after a session was connected.
  - The installer did not handle the answer file option
    INSTALLATION_PROFILE.
  - If FIPS mode was enabled and an SSH1 session was specified as an
    auto session, SecureCRT crashed.


Changes in SecureCRT 6.0.2 (Official) -- April 24, 2008
-------------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - Dot files, such as ".svn", that are in the configuration folder 
    are no longer displayed in the Connect dialog.
  - When the administrative option to disable all scripting is on,
    scripts cannot be recorded.
  - Added the global .INI-file-only option "Focus Does Not Affect 
    Blink" that allows text with the blinking attribute set to blink 
    when the SecureCRT window does not have focus.
  - SSH2: The "Enable OpenSSH agent forwarding" option is now off by
    default.  This only affects new installations.

Bug fixes:

  - When there was a single tab, sending that tab to a new window
    multiple times could cause SecureCRT to crash.
  - Under certain circumstances, attempting to modify a session
    with a logon script could cause SecureCRT to crash.
  - If the File menu was opened and there was not enough room for it
    to be displayed, SecureCRT crashed.
  - If the context menu was displayed for an inactive tab with the
    "Close on disconnect" option set and the tab was disconnected
    while the menu was displayed, selecting a menu item other than
    "Close" caused SecureCRT to crash.
  - The status bar was being updated more than necessary, which
    increased CPU usage.
  - Under certain circumstances, sessions that were disconnected
    could not be reconnected.
  - Pressing CTRL+SHIFT+V did not perform a paste operation.
  - After using Print Setup to select a different printer, printing 
    no longer worked.
  - The option not to display the "Check for Updates" dialog was
    only saved if the "Auto Save Options" option was set.
  - In a script, if a disconnected tab was reconnected, it was
    connected in a new tab.
  - In a script, the ConnectInTab method did not honor the "On
    Error Resume Next" statement.
  - If SecureCRT and SecureFX were installed separately, but used the
    same configuration folder, when a session was created or modified,
    the protocol for the other application was set to None.
  - Accelerator keys defined in custom menu .MNU files were not
    being honored.
  - If a custom menu .MNU file contained more than 1000 items, it
    could not be loaded.
  - Under certain circumstances, the installer incorrectly reported
    a "file in use" error, which prevented the application from
    being installed.
  - Silent installs that specified an ANSWERFILE containing a
    parameter substitution did not work.
  - Under Vista, if an MSI installer was used, the default
    installation folder was in "Application Data" instead of
    "Program Files".
  - Telnet: If a session was saved in the maximized state, the rows
    and columns were not set correctly on the host the next time it
    was connected.
  - SSH2: If a proxy such as Proxycap or Foxy-Proxy was being used,
    SecureCRT crashed when attempting to connect a session that did
    port forwarding.
  - SSH2: SecureCRT could crash if a session was closed while
    attempting to port forward to a destination that was not
    listening or a host that did not resolve.

  - SecureCRT could crash if a session was disconnected while a
    script was in the WaitForStrings function.
  - The WaitForStrings script function incorrectly matched the
    shortest string instead of the longest string.
  - If an auto session contained multiple sessions and the check
    for updates dialog was displayed on startup, only the first
    session connected.

    tab status indicator was not correctly updated.
  - The mnemonic for "Clear Screen and Scrollback" on the Edit menu
    did not work.
  - File browser dialogs could not be resized.

Changes in SecureCRT 6.0 (Beta 4) -- December 18, 2007
------------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:

  - In some cases, when third-party firewall software was installed,
    sessions could not connect.
  - When MENU_WINDOW_NEXT was called from a mapped key or button or
    from a custom .MNU file, SecureCRT crashed.
  - SecureCRT sometimes crashed when doing pass-through printing.
  - When the Activator was used to connect a folder of sessions, not
    all sessions in the folder were connected.
  - The Recently Used Session List wasn't updated when a session was
    selected from the Activator.
  - The UNIX/Linux "resize" command did not work because it could not
    get the rows and columns.
  - If a session was connected and a session with a different number
    of rows and columns was launched in a new window, it had the same
    number of rows and columns as the first session.
  - After running a script that displayed a message box, focus was
    not returned to the session window.
  - If an SFTP tab was sent or dragged to another window, an extra
    "SFTP-" was prepended to the tab title.
  - Telnet/RLogin: Read requests were queued and attempts to process
    data were made when the session was not connected, which resulted
    in a WSAENOTCONNECTED error.
  - Telnet: Zmodem transfers were significantly slower in version 6.0
    than in previous versions.


Changes in SecureCRT 6.0 (Beta 3) -- December 6, 2007
-----------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - The installer no longer requires a reboot upon completion.
  - The U3 installer is now packaged as a .exe instead of a .u3p.
    This prevents it from being downloaded as a .zip.

Bug fixes:

  - Quick Connect did not work when the "Save session" check box was
    unchecked.
  - When the logon Expect and Send strings contained the "%"
    character, SecureCRT attempted to do a variable expansion, which
    caused the logon to fail.
  - Saved passwords were not used when the "Auto Save Options" setting
    was off.
  - Inserting a CTRL+ENTER in the Send string in a button
    configuration caused the button to lose its configuration when
    SecureCRT restarted.
  - When the global option "Only show tabs when there are more than
    one" was set and a session was dragged to a window that only had
    one session, the tabs were not shown.
  - Under certain circumstances, selecting a tab could cause it to
    move unexpectedly to a different position.
  - Under certain circumstances, when using Quick Connect, the
    password prompt appeared in the wrong window.
  - When a recently used script or session path was too long to fit
    in the menu, the path was truncated before the script or session
    name.
  - Telnet and Telnet/SSL: After pressing CTRL+ENTER when output was
    scrolling, it could take a long time for the output to stop.
  - SSH2: When using keyboard-interactive authentication, if an error
    dialog appeared after the password prompt, SecureCRT crashed.


Changes in SecureCRT 6.0 (Beta 2) -- November 26, 2007
------------------------------------------------------

Changes:

  - The U3 installer installs the history and readme files in the
    Exec folder.
  - The U3 installer installs the sample scripts, menus, and keymaps
    in the Data\Examples folder.

Bug fixes:

  - Changing the font of a tabbed session could cause SecureCRT to
    crash.
  - SecureCRT crashed when attempting to enter license data after
    making changes in the Global Options dialog.
  - SecureCRT failed to start if the default session's protocol was
    Serial or TAPI.
  - The session tab was blank when the session used the VT100 font and
    the tab title was set with an escape sequence.
  - If a tab title was set using the titlebar escape sequence and the
    session was sent or dragged to another window, the tab title
    reverted to the session name.
  - Keyboard input was not correct with certain fonts, such as
    Cyrillic, that used UTF-8 character encoding.
  - Text could be pasted into a locked session.
  - The "Autosave Options" setting was always set to true when
    SecureCRT started.
  - If the global option "Save window state for each session" was set
    and a new session was created and connected and then connected in
    a new window, the number of rows was incorrect.
  - When the remote host rejected the connection, SecureCRT
    incorrectly reported the error "The specified network name is no
    longer available".
  - SSH2: SecureCRT crashed on exit when using an SSH2 session with
    three or more port forwards over an SSH2 SOCKS firewall.
  - The amount of disk space the U3 installer checked for was much
    larger than necessary.
  - The U3 version was looking on the hard drive for the menu and
    toolbar XML file.


Changes in SecureCRT 6.0 (Beta 1) -- November 15, 2007
------------------------------------------------------

New features:

  - Added support for sending a tabbed session to a new window and
    cloning a session in a new window.  Sessions can also be dragged
    between SecureCRT windows. 
  - Added an optional button bar that allows buttons to be mapped
    to strings, protocol functions, menu commands, scripts, etc.
    Different button bars can be created so that they can be
    used on a per session or per task basis.
  - Added support for launching external programs on the local
    machine through mapped keys and buttons on the button bar.
  - Added support for alpha transparency.  The transparency can be
    set for the active and inactive windows.  This allows viewing
    of items behind the SecureCRT window and the contents of two
    SecureCRT windows to be compared.
  - Added support for several Windows themes, which give the user
    interface a more modern appearance.
  - Added support for customizing the toolbar and menu by dragging and
    dropping items while in the Customize dialog.
  - Added a new default color scheme, "White / Black", which is a
    white foreground on a black background.
  - Enhanced portability by making a U3 installer available.
    Installing SecureCRT on a U3 drive makes it easier to use on
    any machine.
  - Added MSI installer support.
  - Added optional monthly pop-up dialog that offers to check for
    product updates.
  - Added support for locking sessions with a password while
    connected.  While a session is locked, it cannot be typed in
    or closed.
  - Environment variables can be used in all paths specified in global
    and session options, which allows configuration files to be used
    by more than one person and makes it easier to move configuration
    files to other machines.
  - The autoreconnect prompt and countdown are now displayed in
    the session window instead of in a dialog.  This allows
    connected sessions to be used while a disconnected session is
    trying to reconnect.
  - Added support for the Ymodem file transfer protocol.
  - Added "Connect to multiple sessions sequentially" to the
    Terminal\Advanced page in the Global Options dialog.  When this
    option is set and multiple sessions are connecting, they will
    connect one after the other instead of at the same time.
  - Added a global option not to reuse disconnected tabs for
    connecting new sessions.
  - Extended the command-line options to support a username@hostname
    format.
  - Added new Session script object function LogUsingSessionOptions
    that uses the specified session's logging options.
  - Telnet: Added a session option to enable/disable NTLM
    authentication.
  - SSH2: Added a command-line option to specify the compression
    type(s).

Changes:

  - The standard toolbar icons have been updated to use Windows Vista
    icons.
  - SecureCRT dialogs now use the font specified by the Windows
    display properties.
  - The line and character send delay settings, which were global
    settings, are now session-specific settings.
  - The scrollback buffer can be set to be up to 128,000 lines.
  - If the logging option "Append to file" is set and the session
    .INI file option "Log Multiple Sessions" is off, when one
    session is already logging to a file and another session tries
    to log to the same file, the user will be prompted for a
    different log file.
  - When recording a script, crt.Screen.Synchronous is set to true by
    default.  This prevents data being lost by the script sending data
    too fast to be transmitted to the remote system.
  - If a script that does not exist is selected from the recently
    used script list, a prompt asking if it should be removed from
    the list is displayed.
  - The "Save password" check box is no longer shown on the "Enter
    Password" dialog when the "Auto Save Options" setting is off.
  - The global settings "Copy on Select" and "Paste on right button"
    are on by default.  This only affects new installations.
  - Pressing the "+" key on the numpad now produces a "+"
    character in Linux and ANSI emulations.
  - Improved the error message that is displayed when attempting
    to give a session a name that is already being used.

Bug fixes:

  - SecureCRT could crash when applying default session changes to all
    sessions.
  - Files with Unicode names may not have been named correctly when
    transferred using Zmodem.
  - Pasting into a SecureCRT session from an RDP session caused
    SecureCRT to hang.
  - When using TrueType or ClearType fonts in a session, the right
    edge of some characters was cut off.
  - If the session options "ANSI Color" and "Use Color Scheme" were
    enabled for the first tab, if a second tab was connected, the
    background color was not correct.
  - The command-line option /POS did not override the session's
    initial position.
  - If a relative path was specified for a custom menu that
    contained a script path and a log file that was in a different
    location than the script was used, the script could not be
    found.
  - Xmodem transfers could fail when the remote machine sent a NAK.
    SecureCRT now handles the NAK.
  - Unicode characters were not displayed correctly in the title bar.
  - When the SecureCRT window was as tall as the monitor and then the
    chat window was shown, text in the session was obscured.
  - Some menu item labels, such as Copy and About, could not be
    customized.
  - DOS device names such as CON, NUL, PRN, COM1, COM2, etc.
    could be used as session names.
  - SSH1/SSH2: When a password was specified in a URL session, it
    was not used.
  - Telnet/SSL: Connecting to a server that was using a certificate
    with a large key size, could have resulted in the following error:
    "The buffers supplied to a function was too small".
  - SFTP tab downloads failed if the file contained any characters 
    that were illegal on the local file system (i.e., \ / : * ? " < 
    > | ).  SecureCRT now replaces any illegal characters with an 
    underscore during the download.
